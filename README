    the easy goin' large scale OS

Reyx (pronounced: ray-icks) is a "parasite operating system". This means it can not run on its own, it needs a host OS to run. This may seem like a disadvantage at first, but you can program everything in Ruby! Plus, you get a high level API that is really easy to program in.

* setting up the environment.
    Just run "rake".

* getting up and running
    Well, first, you need to start the server.
        bin/server
    Then, in a new terminal, start the client.
        bin/client
    You may now run commands.
